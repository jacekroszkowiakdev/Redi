Exercise: Create a Personal Portfolio Page
Task: Create a personal portfolio webpage that showcases your skills and interests. The
webpage should include a header with navigation links, a section with a table of your
skills, an embedded video, and a section with anchor links to external projects.

Requirements:

1. Use an external CSS file to style your webpage.
2. Use semantic HTML elements where appropriate (e.g., <header>, <section>,
 <table>).
3. Apply CSS to create a visually appealing layout for your portfolio.

Tasks:

1. Create a CSS file named "styles.css" and link it to the HTML document.
2. Design a header that includes your name as the page title and navigation links (e.g.,
   Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact).
3. In the "About" section, provide a brief description of yourself or your interests.
4. Create a table in the "Skills" section to list your skills. Include at least three columns
   and three rows in the table.
5. In the "Projects" section, include at least three anchor links that lead to external
   projects or websites. Use appropriate text for each link.
6. In the "Video" section, embed a video from a video-sharing platform (e.g., YouTube)
   that showcases your work or interests.
