                <h1>About me:</h1>
                <p>
                    Hey there! I'm an ambitious developer with a knack for IT
                    Project Management. My coding journey kicked off in 2021
                    when I joined forces with the IOTA Foundation. During my
                    time there, I got to tinker with a bunch of backend tech
                    like NestJS, NodeJs/Express, and even gave Svelte a spin.
                    After that adventure, I jumped on board with MOWEA GmbH,
                    where I wore the hats of a web developer and DevOps
                    engineer. I dug into UNIX systems, had Ubuntu and Raspbian
                    on my radar. Right now, I'm riding the front-end wave
                    because, hey, that's where the fun's at! React is my jam,
                    and I'm all about the creative challenges it throws at me.
                    When it comes to projects, I'm all about being open-minded,
                    creative, and an ace communicator. Diverse environments are
                    my playground. Oh, and did I mention I'm fluent in both
                    Polish and English? That means I can chat it up in
                    multicultural settings without a hitch. ðŸ˜Ž
